Introduction to Neural Networks (PyTorch)

This project is part of a workshop and explains the basics of neural networks using PyTorch.
It shows how a simple neural network can learn patterns from data using training.

What is This Project About?

In this project, we train a small neural network to learn an XOR-like problem, which cannot be solved using simple linear rules.
This helps beginners understand why neural networks are useful.

Key Concepts Used:

👉PyTorch Tensors

👉Neural Networks

👉Forward Pass

👉Loss Function

👉Backpropagation

👉Optimizer (Adam)

Dataset Explanation

Input (X)

Each row represents one data point with two features:
[0, 0]

[0, 1]

[1, 1]

[1, 0]

Output (y)

Each value is the expected result for the corresponding input:
[0]

[1]

[1]

[0]

This pattern is called XOR, which requires a neural network to solve.

Neural Network Structure :

The model is created using nn.Sequential, which connects layers one after another.

Output

Layer Explanation :

1.Linear (2 → 4): Converts input into 4 features

2.ReLU: Adds non-linearity so the model can learn complex patterns

3Linear (4 → 1): Produces the final output

Training the Model:
The model is trained for 1000 iterations.
Each training step includes:
👉Clearing old gradients

👉Passing input through the model

👉Calculating error using MSE Loss

👉Updating weights using Adam Optimizer

This process helps the model improve step by step.

Final Output ✅
After training, the model gives the following predictions:
tensor([[ 0.0000],
        [ 1.0000],
        [ 1.0000],
        [-0.0000]])
